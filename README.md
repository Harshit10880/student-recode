📝 Student Report Card System (Python - No Libraries)
📌 Overview
The Student Report Card System is a simple, console-based Python application built using only core Python — with no third-party libraries. It enables users (like teachers, students, or school admins) to store, retrieve, and manage student academic records, compute average marks, and assign grades automatically based on predefined logic.

This project simulates a real-world use case of a school or college’s backend reporting system using file handling and basic logic.


🔹 Add new student records (Roll number, Name, Subject Marks)

🔹 View all saved student records in a clean tabular format

🔹 Search any student by Roll Number and get details instantly

🔹 Automatically calculate average marks and grade

🔹 Data persistence using .txt files — all records are saved locally

🔹 User-friendly menu system for navigating options

🔹 No external libraries — only built-in Python functionality used


💡 How It Works
1.  The user is greeted with a main menu containing all available options.

2.  When adding a student, the program takes input for roll number, name, and marks.

3.  Data is saved to a students.txt file line-by-line using string formatting.

4.  when searching, the roll number is matched and the line is parsed to extract subject marks.

5.  An average is calculated, and a grade is assigned based on predefined logic.
