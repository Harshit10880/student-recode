📝 Student Report Card System (Python - No Libraries)
📌 Overview
The Student Report Card System is a simple, console-based Python application built using only core Python — with no third-party libraries. It enables users (like teachers, students, or school admins) to store, retrieve, and manage student academic records, compute average marks, and assign grades automatically based on predefined logic.

This project simulates a real-world use case of a school or college’s backend reporting system using file handling and basic logic.
